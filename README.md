# CS131_Assignments
This reposity contains my solutions for the released assignments of the [fall 2019](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs131_fall1920) iteration of CS 131, a course at Stanford taught by J[Juan Carlos Niebles](http://www.niebles.net) and [Ranjay Krishna](http://ranjaykrishna.com).  

There are still some problems to be solved.Most of them are some "extra credit" problems,and I will finish them in the future.
